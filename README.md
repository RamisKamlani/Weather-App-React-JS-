# Weather-App-React-JS

This was my first time working on front end and web development.

Design Approach:
I created a simple, responsive weather web app using React.js and the OpenWeatherMap API. The user enters a city name, and the app fetches and displays current weather data such as temperature, condition, and an icon representing the weather.

Key Features:
City input via text box
Real-time weather fetching using fetch()
Error handling (e.g. invalid city or failed API call)
Weather icon shown via OpenWeatherMap's icon API
Clean, web-friendly UI

Design Decisions
React with Vite: I used Vite for quick setup and fast development. React is great for building UI components in a modular and interactive way.
State Management: I used React’s useState hook to manage city input, weather data, and error messages.
Responsive Design: The layout uses CSS Flexbox and media-friendly sizes to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
Minimal UI: I chose a clean and simple design for clarity and focus on the main functionality. I avoided adding too many features to keep it easy to understand and use.
API Integration: I built the fetch logic to handle both success and error cases to improve reliability and user feedback.
